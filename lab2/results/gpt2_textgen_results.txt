 In the middle of the journey of our life, I found myself in a small village in the middle of nowhere. We were all in the same boat.

 In the middle of the journey of our life, I found myself in a room of people whose names had not been changed. I found myself looking at them with a deep, dark satisfaction. It would be like watching a young child sit at attention on a large table with his or her mother. There will be a pause in the thought as to why I would listen. I had been very anxious about becoming a writer, but I felt more satisfied with my life because it was now complete. We had taken a long break from our lives, and we had begun toDsl the journey together. There was no place for me to be alone. I had left home and found myself in a world of strangers or strange people who had not yet arrived here
